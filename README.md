# Piazza

## Installation

## How I use it

I typically keep a bunch of folders around denoting where I took them, the time, the event, or some other descriptor with the descriptor naming the album.
Each folder will two folders listed as to edit (_TODO) and those I finished (_FINISHED).
Then at the beginning of my folder; I have a to edit (__TODO) and a finished folder (__FINISHED).

There is a script that, upon running, transfers all TODO and FINISHED files from the inidividual files to the upper level folder.
To run it:
```
bash file_sorting.bash
```

## Things to come
I want to create sub-folders for each folder and for they to be autopopulated and tracked.
Ideally, there will be a way to rename the files to show what file they're from. Or a sym-link
